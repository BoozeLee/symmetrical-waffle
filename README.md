# Qwen-Assisted Sentiment Analysis Project with Latest Polymorphic Research Integration

## Project Overview

This project leverages the latest Qwen2.5-Coder-7B model to create an advanced sentiment analysis classifier that incorporates recent breakthroughs in polymorphic malware detection techniques and machine learning methodologies. The integration of polymorphic research enhances the model's robustness against adversarial attacks and improves feature engineering approaches.

## Latest Research Integration Updates (2025)

### Polymorphic Research Advances
Based on the most recent studies in 2025, we're incorporating:

1. **Advanced Feature Engineering Approaches**
   - Novel Feature Engineering (NFE) techniques for better classification
   - Structural feature engineering with machine learning integration
   - Hybrid detection methods combining static and dynamic analysis

2. **Machine Learning Enhancements**
   - Random Forest algorithms achieving 99% detection accuracy
   - XGBoost models with Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA)
   - Support Vector Machines with improved polymorphic variant detection

3. **Sequence-Based Classification**
   - STRAND algorithm implementation for similarity detection
   - Minihash techniques for feature comparison
   - Ensemble methods combining multiple detection approaches

## Usage

### Training the Model
```python
from src.training.trainer import PolymorphicSentimentTrainer

# Initialize trainer
trainer = PolymorphicSentimentTrainer()

# Train model
trainer.train()

# Save model
trainer.save_model('models/checkpoints/best_model.pt')
```

### Inference
```python
from src.models.qwen_sentiment_model import PolymorphicSentimentAnalyzer

# Load trained model
model = PolymorphicSentimentAnalyzer.load_pretrained('models/checkpoints/best_model.pt')

# Inference example
text = "This movie is absolutely fantastic!"
sentiment = model.predict(text)
confidence = model.get_confidence(text)

print(f"Sentiment: {sentiment} (Confidence: {confidence:.3f})")
```
